        <p><span>Q:</span> What can we expect for the future if we mint a Tv Punk? </p>
        <p><span>A:</span> Our plan is to use this project as a genesis for many more projects to come! Our artist is amazing and we are going to be working on many projects this year together. If you own an original 'Tv Punk' You will be granted whitelist/or a cheaper mint price in future projects!
